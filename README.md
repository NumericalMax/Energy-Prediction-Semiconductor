# Predict formation- and bandgap energy in semiconductors

The script was implemented for the purpose of the Nomad2018 challenge run by Kaggle.

## Supposed folder structure

- Energy-Prediction-Semiconductor
  -- input
    -- test
    -- train

## Outcome
The outcome are the predictions for the formation- and bandgap energies of the testdata. The data are stored in a txt file, which can be directly submitted to the competition.

## Results
By now the RMSLE metric gives 0.0549 based on 100 test samples. As soon as the competition ends I will upload a more accurate approach to this topic. Hence,
