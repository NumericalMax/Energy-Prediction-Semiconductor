# Predict formation- and bandgap energy in semiconductors

The script was implemented for the purpose of the Nomad2018 challenge run by Kaggle.

## Outcome
Predictions for the formation- and bandgap energies of the testdata.

## Results
The RMSLE metric yield currently 0.0549 based on approximately 100 test samples. As soon as the competition ends, I will upload a refined approach to this topic.
